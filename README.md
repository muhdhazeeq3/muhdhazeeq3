- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @muhdhazeeq3
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in to learn all that I can on this non-stop evolving technology but I know that in my current life it is not enough time to learn all therefore I'll just start to learn one by one.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on how to make a functional website from scratch but right now I slowly learn to make a web using the AngularJS.
